            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter it had pleased God to give so clear a Decision of those Contests, which the Well-affected People of this Nation for many years together had with the late King, and his Party, and those who after him espoused that Interest, and engaged upon the same bottom, That the Adversaries were wholly vanquisht, and both their Persons and Estates, through the gracious dispensations of God, subjected to the power of those whom they had designed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave and ruine; It was hoped that, that visible hand of God, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared against them in the War upon all occasions, would have had suitable impressions, and been sufficient to convince them of the error of their way, and engaged them to desert it, with those Principles of Licentiousness and Prophaneness, which the Heads and Leaders of that Party had long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to debauch the Nation with, and so obliged them not only to live peaceably under that Power, which they were so eminently by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God brought under, but laying aside the remembrance of former differences, to endeavour in their several capacities, the carrying on, and maintaining the Peace and good of the Whole, especially if they should see an end of their troubles, and themselves put into such a condition, that they might not be liable to future revenge for what was past, but might be free both in their Estates and Persons equally with other men. And therefore as it was most evident, aswel by their being admitted at first to compound for their Estates, as also in the tearms of their Composition (which were so easie and moderate to the generality, as that it led them to a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of support than generally befell the Parliaments Party, considering their many and large Payments to maintain a long and expencefull War) That the Original Intention of those who had then the Conduct of Affairs, was not to extirpate these men with designs of possessing their Estates and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44841:3"/> Fortunes, but at first only to defend their Liberties, and after to deprive them of those Arms wherewith they designed to enslave themselves, and the whole Nation, leaving them in that condition after they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as they might live in their former qualities, enjoying their Estates and equal Protection with those whom they had endeavoured to destroy; (A proceeding very extraordinary, if compared with that which other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all Ages have endured after a like disappointment by Civil War, who have held it for a principle, That Settlement after such Commotions is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and conserved by a total disabling the very inclinations of those in times of Peace, whose actions have been dangerous in War; And in this Nation in former Ages, loss of Life, and Confiscation, having been very usually the Consequences in the like Cases) We say, as the clear Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Parliaments Party were discovered and manifest in their first proceedings with their Enemies, to wit, That they designed not their Ruine, but Reformation: So after the Battel of <hi>Worcester,</hi> upon that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable day of the Third of <hi>September,</hi> when the hopes of the Enemy seemed to be wholly broken, having neither Forces in the Feild, nor Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison left in <hi>England;</hi> And <hi>Scotland,</hi> which until then, might be some ground of Confidence to them, and of danger to Us, so far subdued that no considerable Enemy was left there; which also was the condition of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when al things were reduced into that state &amp; condition, that as these men could in reason have but small, or no hopes of any change of affairs, or new opportunities to assert their old Cause; So had we, through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Assistance and Presence of God, no ground to fear any new Attempts from them, that might oblige Us to any base and unworthy Compliance with them: All endeavours were used on this side, to lay Foundations of composing the Spirits, and uniting a broken and divided People, through a ten years War: There was not only a punctual performance of Articles of War, the like whereof no History can parallel, (A Court being purposely errected to do them Justice in that particular, and the Power thereof en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted in such hands, who (as was intended in their choice) did execute it effectually on their behalf) but an Act of Grace and Oblivion was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; Which favour, as they could not have any pretensions to claim, or indeed expect, So neither could the Makers thereof have any other Motives or Arguments to induce them thereunto, but such as must proceed from the desires they had to heal and cement, and to take away all seeds of difference and separation, and of putting what was past into Ob<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivion, by means whereof the hearts of the Nation, unhappily divided, might chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44841:3"/> and affectionately meet in mutual Interest; on which might follow Peace, Settlement, and Reformation, and consequently the Taxes and Burdens which have been long continued, might be safely taken from off the People.</p>
            <p>Upon these Grounds also was it, that so great respect was had to this sort of men in the Settlement of the present Government, wherby they were admitted after three Parliaments, to be Elected to sit in the Supream Councils of the Nation.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, some opposition was made to that lenity which was used towards this Party, and more especially to the Act of Oblivion, many being of this perswasion, That it would not work those good Effects as were designed and wished, but on the contrary, that all this indulgence would be abused, and opportunities given thereby of raising new troubles, to the endangering of the Cause We had so long contended for; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet the Parliament it Self were of a different Judgement from them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it impossible that there should be any sort of men so devoid of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and Candor, or so resolved in their way, that neither the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of God, nor Kindness of men, could work upon them; However, it was thought, That in case they were mistaken, and that it should so fall out in fact, and upon experience, that those who were by the mighty and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretcht Hand of the LORD, brought into a condition to ask favour, to solicite for the blotting out the remembrance of past actions, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the Common Priviledges of the Nation, which they had justly forfeited, should yet dispise and reject it when it was offered, and retain their enmity after that they had been forced from their Arms, It would then have this effect at least, The leaving of such without excuse in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever ways of severity the State should be necessitated to proceed with them in, for providing for, and securing the Peace of the Nation, when ways of tenderness were by them rendred ineffectual to those ends: And We do acknowledge, unless the carriage towards them had been such as is before exprest, We could not with Comfort and Satisfaction to Our Selves, have used the Course We now see We are obliged to take against the Persons and Estates of that Party, for securing the Lives, Liberties, Peace and Comfort of all the well-affected People of these three Nations.</p>
            <p>But it having pleased God in his providence so to order things, that there was not onely forbearance, and moderation used towards them, and hopes given that they might enjoy their Freedom, and have equall prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their Persons and Estates with the rest of the Nation, but they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44841:4"/> might claim it as their Right, and as due unto them by the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Land, as well as any person whatsoever who had been of this side; There can be no other Construction made of the Actings of that Party, to the disturbance of the Publick Peace, and to the subversion of the Government, but that they are implacable in their malice and revenge, and never to be drawn from their adhering to that cursed interest, which hath been the occasion of the shedding of so much innocent blood, and almost of the ruin and destruction of these Lands. And therefore We do not now onely find Our self satisfied, but obliged in duty, both towards God and this Nation, to proceed upon other grounds then formerly, with those who shall deserve this Character; and the Articles of War, Act of Oblivion, and other favours tendered, yea, granted to these men, are so far from lying in Our way, or begetting scruples in Our mind, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, That Our hands are strengthened from thence to this work, and many doubts removed thereby, which otherwise would have stuck with Us, as We have before exprest.</p>
            <p>It will not be denyed, That as well the Articles of War, as the favour and grace granted by the Act of Oblivion, contained in them a Reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As there did a reall benefit and advantage accrue to the Grantees, so certainly was there a good intended and designed by them to the State; If the State do not attain their end, neither ought the other to accomplish theirs. In such Acts as these are, either both are bound, or both are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and in the same condition, as if no such thing had been done or acted; certainly none have signed to Articles of War, that are not conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, or when those who received those Articles, resolved to break the conditions, they had not then the consent of those who gave them, Who did ever allow such Articles to Enemies, as might assist them to execute their malice and revenge? If no breach of faith can make a forfeiture of Articles, the condition of those who receive them, is better than of him that gives them, because he submits himself to surprize, after he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the hazard and expence of open War.</p>
            <p>And as for the Act of Oblivion, That must needs be meant as an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Enemy, and as a proper means to take away the Enmity contracted by the War, intending by mercy to reform those who had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselves to the publick welfare; and this need not be expressed, It doth imply such a condition in the nature of it; all pardons are granted with clauses of good behaviour, either explicite or implied because else who ever grants them, lets loose a Delinquent to a future offence, and he that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44841:4"/> answers not the end and consideration of the pardon, cannot in reason be said ever to accept it. The Parliament by that Act, intended not onely an Oblivion of the offences of the aforsaid Party, whereby they had rendred themselves obnoxious, but that this kindnesse should be answered with obedience on their part, and produce a real change in their principles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as to the common cause this great Contest had been about, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise this Act cannot be considered as obligatory to those who gave it: And in this case Forbearance from outward action will nor avail, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title to the benefit of the Pardon, if yet there be malice and revenge in the heart, and such a leaning and adhering to the old interest, that nothing is wanting for the discovery therof, but a fitting opportunity; for as such men cannot in Justice and Ingenuity claim the benefit of an Act of Favour from that Supream Magistrate, to whom they know themselves to be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, so neither is that Magistrate bound in Justice before God or Men to give it to them, if he hath reason to believe from the course of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations that they are such, and that their Intentions towards the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live, are the same, as when they were in open Arms against it, and is at Liberty to carry himself towards them, as if no such Act had been; Nay, He may proceed against them with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter severity, in as much as he hath used the last means to reclaim them without fruit, and knows by experience, That nothing but the Sword will restrain them from blood and violence.</p>
            <p>Then if this be the Case between Us and the late Kings Party, to wit, That they have notoriously manifested it to the consciences of all men, that they do not only retain their old Principles, and still adhere to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer interest in direct opposition to the Government established, but have been all along hatching new disturbances, and endeavouring as well by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and bloody Assassinations, as by open force, to introduce the one, and overthrow and subvert the other; It will not be thought strange upon any account whatsoever, that We did lately secure so many of the men of that Interest, although they were not visibly in Arms upon the late Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; nor that We have laid a burden upon some of their Estates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is imposed upon the rest of the Nation, towards the defraying of that Charge which they are the occasion of, with some other things which We have found necessary in this time of Danger to direct concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, for the Peace and Safety of the whole.</p>
            <p>Now to evince this, though the Walks of Conspirators, who are a sly and secret Generation of men, are ever in the Dark, and the measure of all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44841:5"/> their Feet cannot be exactly taken and compared, yet many of their steps having been discovered through the goodnesse of the all-seeing God, We shall set down such part thereof as may be of use to make publique.</p>
            <p>We shall not particularly mention some underhand, and very secret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances which they had, and made some Trial of, whereby they would have insensibly wound themselves into that power, which they were not able to do by open force; But that way not taking, they then betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Counsels of raising a new War, and designing a generall Insurecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on throughout the Nation.</p>
            <p>And to ripen those Resolutions, some persons were sent from hence to <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> with Letters of Credit, and a considerable Sum of Money (the better to gain belief) to give him assurance, That the reasons why the Nobility and Gentry, and bulk of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> which (they said) were Episcopall, and of his former Party, did not rise with him upon his late March from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was, because he was believed to have gone upon grounds disagreeable both to their affections and Interests, and also to the good of the Nation, and inconsistent with the antient Constitutions both of Church and State, but that if he would return to his former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to wit, To cast himself totally upon his Old Party, they would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both their lives and fortunes for his Recovery.</p>
            <p>This being received with great acceptance, and the design resolved upon, the management thereof was to be as followeth.</p>
            <p>A Council was chosen of a select number, called by the name of a <hi>Sealed Knot,</hi> who were for the most part to reside in, and about <hi>London,</hi> and to keep and maintain Correspondencies with those of their Party beyond Sea, and within the severall parts of the Nation, and communicate the mutuall Advices, Counsels, Orders and Resolutions of each other, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for such an undertaking. And there were three things which were chiefly designed by them in this businesse.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To prepare and engage every individuall man of their own party, who had either been in the former Wars, or had been a friend thereto, or was likely by reason of his alliance, breeding, or discontents, to engage therein; who being engaged were to bring all their Tenants, and those who depended upon them, and also to lay Designs for the possessing of Garrisons and Strong-holds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To raise a considerable Bank of Money to be employed for buying of Arms, defraying other expences incident to the management of such a business, and for the maintenance of Forces, as occasion should be; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44841:5"/> for this one hundred thousand pounds was propounded for <hi>England</hi> alone, besides what was to be had in <hi>Wales;</hi> for the raising whereof, privy Seals were to be sent to severall persons in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. During the carrying on of this Affair, <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> was to be maintained, and therefore a constant Contribution of Money was to be endeavoured from such of his Friends as were able; and this latter was so well prosecuted by those Agents which were imployed therein, that he hath had many thousand pounds a year paid him from hence for these three years past. The two other things were to be carryed on, and managed by the said <hi>Sealed Knot,</hi> and such Agents as went between him and his Friends here.</p>
            <p>But as previous hereunto, and to make their Work the more easie and uninterrupted, and the Design they had thus engaged in, the more sure in the execution (which they could not in reason but apprehend to have many difficulties in it, whilest the Nation was in perfect peace, and so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to settlement and rest, as being weary of the former Commotions, that whosoever should begin new troubles upon any pretences whatsoever, would be lookt upon as a Common Enemy, and might possibly finde the generality of the Nation so far from joyning with them, that they might declare the contrary way; As also whilest the Army was in an united Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and under its ancient Conduct, it would be difficult for them to rise, without being supprest, before they should be able to imbody in any such considerable number, as might give countenance and protection to such as should joyn themselves with them) They concluded some things to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as preceding to, or at least contemporary with the Generall <hi>Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One was the Assassination of particular persons, thereby to beget great Confusions and Contests, and give opportunity for all the Kings Party to rise. There was one <hi>Fitz-James</hi> went from hence to the late Kings eldest Son, upon this account, then at <hi>Paris,</hi> and had a summe of Money given him to promote that attempt, but he and <hi>John Gerard</hi> afterwards joyned in that Design, the particulars whereof have been heretofore published; whereto We shall onely adde what is since more fully come to Our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (to makelit manifest that it was not the heady and rash resolution of <hi>Gerard</hi> himself, but that it was a part of the Design laid by the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded King, and of those who have the Conduct of his Affairs) That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self spake to both <hi>Fitz-James</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi> concerning it, and did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve thereof, but declared, that he looked upon it as a most necessary, if not the onely means to set all his other Designs on Motion; It's true, he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44841:6"/> refused to speak with Major <hi>Henshaw,</hi> who went to <hi>Paris</hi> about the same time, or a little before, concerning the Design, and conferred with Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> concerning it, by means of one <hi>Chookly</hi> a French-man; the Prince communicated it to <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> who approved of the Under-taking, and resolved to speak with him therein; our advertisement coming from <hi>England,</hi> in the mean time that <hi>Henshaw</hi> was sent from hence and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Paris</hi> to abuse them there, he refused afterwards to see him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed on <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Fitz-James,</hi> to whom he gave precise Directions, that they should not make their Attempt till all his Friends were ready in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> There was also one <hi>Boswel,</hi> and also one <hi>Pierce,</hi> and severall other persons imployed at other times for those Assassinations, and had laid the place and manner of execution, and the means whereby to attempt it; all the particulars whereof would be too large to set down, as it would the severall gracious Providences of God in the disappointing of them.</p>
            <p>Another part of their design was, to work upon the severall disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humours which they observed to be stirring in the Nation, imploying fitting Instruments, who might from a true observation of their spirits and principles, fall in with all manner of discontented Parties, and by proper mediums heighten and blow up their discontents, and provoke them to a Rupture, laying this for their Maxim, <hi>Divide &amp; impera;</hi> the more Parties they could make, the greater confusions they could bring forth, the easier would their work be: And therefore some they set up, who might abuse one sort of men, and draw them into discontents, upon pretences of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the rights of the free-born People of <hi>England,</hi> which they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed were infringed by keeping up an Army, and by inforcing Taxes from them, and by not calling a free and equal Representative, chosen by all the People; and upon this subject, there was scarce a day but some Pamphlet or other came forth in Print, called Declarations, Penned, Printed and Published by the Kings Party, some whereof are now in prison, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not in it themselves, but imployed other Instruments. And they found <hi>John Wildman,</hi> and some others of the like Principles, most fitting Instruments for managing that part, of crying for Liberty, as those who might do it (as they imagined) without the least suspition of being thought to correspond therein with the old Enemy, or of having intentions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Cause &amp; Interest. And therefore these were to carry on a design, which should in outward appearance be different from the other, (although in truth it came from the same root, and was directed to the same end) and to this purpose they had continuall meetings with such as they judged to be like themselves, and of the same mind with them; And though they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44841:6"/> themselves had turned their backs upon that Profession of Christ and the Gospel, which they had once made, and were become loose in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and Atheistical in their Principles; yet they found means, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their having been engaged on this Part, to insinuate into, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with, and deeply influence some particular persons, otherwise (as We hope) well-minded, in design against the Government, partly upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Liberty, and partly upon supposition of having a more pure Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of things; Upon which subject likewise many Papers were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dispersed at the same time, and many others were in preparation.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Wildman</hi> had brought his part to such maturity, that he wanted very little but the open declaring himself in Arms, having in effect finished the Declaration which was to be published upon that occasion, as appears by the Declaration it self; but it pleased God to prevent it by his sudden and unexpected apprehension, with his Declaration before him, just as he was dictating to his Servant the conclusion therof; and the time that he should have declared himself, did fully answer the Rising designed by the Royal-Party, which fell out but a few days after.</p>
            <p>Another thing which the Enemy had laid as necessary, at least to keep company with their intended Insurrection, was, That part of the Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> should have mutified, surprized their Generals, thrown off their Officers, and marched up to <hi>London</hi> under the command of Major General <hi>Overton</hi> (who was designed for that purpose) leaving the rest of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there, already under great discouragement, by reason of their late hard service, and for want of pay, to be devoured by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and also Forts and Garrisons lately erected at the vast charge of this Commonwealth, to be possest by them, there being no posibility left of sending them timely and seasonable Supplies, in such times of trouble as must necessarily ensue such actings; And those who were made use of to bring this to pass, were the <hi>Levellers,</hi> and also some others, who did not (as we hope) intend to serve the interest of <hi>Charls Stuart.</hi> But it is clear, that they were influenced and driven on by them, being made to beleeve by the Emissaries of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended King (Wolves in Sheeps clothing) that that part of the Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the Revolt, would under the conduct aforesaid, do much for the carrying on their business, not foreseeing, that the Army being thus divided and engaged against it self. It may be, even to blood, would become a prey to the Enemy, and yeeld up this <hi>Glorious Cause,</hi> and the good People of this Land, into their hands. These were some of those Methods which Our Enemies made use of to prepare their way to their grand Design; others they had of lesser moment, which We shall not spend Our time in rehears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44841:7"/> nor shall We in express terms lay to their charge, the swarming of those Jesuits which are now croaking amongst Us, turning themselves into all Forms and shapes, to deceive and seduce men from the Truth, according as they find the bents, inclinations and principles of men to be.</p>
            <p>It is not only commonly observed, but there remains with Us somewhat in proof, That Jesuits have been found amongst some discontented Parties of this Nation, who are observed to quarrel and fall out with every form of Administration either in the Church or State. Whether these Emissaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are come hither by counsel from <hi>Charls Stewart,</hi> We will not now examine; This is certain, as the continual Troubles and Unsettlement, occasioned by his Party here, opens the door for the entrance in of those unclean Spirits; So his Agents make use of them to advance one part of his work, to wit, The fomenting and maintaining of Parties and Factions amongst Us.</p>
            <p>And that they might the better know what directions to give, and what means they were to use from time to time, for influencing the aforesaid Parties, and arriving at their Ends, these following Instructions were given, amongst other things, to some of their <hi>Agents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were to inform themselves,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What the present Strength of the Army in</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>is? by whom Commanded? who have the chief Interest in them, and how they and their Officers are affected?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What are the principal Garrisons, especially Ports? how manned, and of what Strength, and which are the easiest to be gained, either by Force, or Treaty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What the present Strength is at Sea, and how intended to be setled for the future?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>What the constant Revenues, and constant Expences of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth are? how much the one exceeds the other? and if the Expences be greater, by what means the Overplus is supplied?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>What is the condition of Trade, whether much decayed? and what Consequences that may draw?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Whether the Protector be absolute in his power, or forced to comply with others? who are his chiefest Friends or Enemies, and who have at present the greatest Power in</hi> England? <hi>how the People and Army stand affected to the new Government, and Person of the Protector?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>What Parties and Factions are now on foot? what their strength; principles and inclinations as to the present Government, on a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the King? and who are their cheif Leaders?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44841:7"/>8. <hi>What be the present Designs of the Protector, and the governing Party, as to War or Peace with foreign Nations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>What is done in</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Scotland <hi>towards the Reduction of the Kings Party in the Highlands?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Instructions do further shew what that Party was doing here amongst Us.</p>
            <p>Whilest these Engines were at work, the Enemy doth all they can to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their design of a <hi>General Rising,</hi> that all might be ready at once; Agents to that purpose are employed in the several parts of the Nation, and every ones particular station appointed to them; some were for the West, others for the North, others for the East, others for <hi>Surry, Kent, &amp;c.</hi> and others for <hi>Wales;</hi> their work was to speak with such persons as were likely to joyn with them, and if they accepted, to acquaint them with what Resolutions were taken for the carrying on the Design, and the time for the execution thereof, with what else related thereto.</p>
            <p>One chief part thereof was upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> where great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were used to engage the Youth, Apprentices, and common sort of men, who might be able to raise combustions, by firing the City or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, thereby to prevent their appearing in Arms against them.</p>
            <p>Privy Seals were sent unto several persons for raising of Money for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this Work, and Treasurers appointed for receiving the same, and several very considerable Sums paid in, a part whereof was discovered, and seized upon.</p>
            <p>Great quantities of Arms, and other Provisions of War, especially for Horsemen, were bought; many whereof were sent into the respective Counties, and lodged in the hands of persons engaged in this Design; some We seized upon in the Country, and some in their Magazine in <hi>London;</hi> Commissions were also sent in great numbers from <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to several of his Party, to raise Horse and Foot. Besides, they had been soliciting Forreign Princes to give them assistance of Men and Money to invade this Country; whom, although they found not very forward in undertaking any such Enterprize, until some Sea-Town of strength could be put into their hands, yet they did procure some sums of Money from them; and were not without good Assurances of further Aid both of Men and Money, when they could secure them a place of Landing and Retreat.</p>
            <p>Things being thus prepared, and a full accompt thereof given to their pretended King, although he was very desirous to have come attended with some Forreign Aids, yet seeing his Party to be in so good a readiness, he encouraged them to proceed to the Execution; and promised them to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44841:8"/> in some convenient place not far distant, at such time as they should let him know the particular Day agreed upon by them for making their attempt, to come over hither, as he should finde his opportunity. The Letter he writ to his party upon this occasion, is as followeth:
<floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <p>YOu will easily believe, that I am very well pleased to hear how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and solicitous you are for my Concernments, and of the course you resolve to take. The truth is, I have been so tender of my Friends, that I have deferred to call upon them to appear, till I could find my self able to give them good Encouragement from abroade but since I find that comes on so slowly, I will no longer restrain those Affections which I most desire to be beholding to; and I have reason to believe, That if they who wish one and the same thing, knew each others minde, the Work would be done without any difficulty; and if there were any handsom Appearance in any one place, the rest would not sit still; and I am perswaded I should then finde Supplies from those, who are yet afraid to offer them: However, I am sure I would my self be with those who first wished for me, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I will keep my self within a reasonable distance.

               </floatingText>
            </p>
            <p>After the receipt of this Letter, their Affairs grew apace unto a ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and they found their Party so unanimously and universally resolved, and every thing so agreeable to their wishes, that (as severall of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons acknowledged afterwards upon their Examinations) they thought it impossible for Us, though they should fully acquaint Us with the whole Contrivements, to prevent their Designs. And now, whereas some of them were of opinion, that they should take in some persons who had been for the Parliament, and were discontented, to make their Busines the surer; it was denied by others of them, upon this Reason, That seeing they had no need of them, as their Affairs now stood, it would be prejudiciall to his Majesties Service, and their common Interest, to take in Persons whom they should afterwards be troubled to be rid of: by which may be seen, the confidence they had of the successe of their undertaking.</p>
            <p>As for the time of executing what had been in their apprehension thus surely laid, they varied their Counsels in that particular, according as they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44841:8"/> found the opportunities for the same to be more or less advantageous. They once resolved to take the occasion of Horse-Races, which they had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in severall places for that purpose; whither they and their Servants should have come well Horsed and Armed, &amp; so have declared themselves; but they were prevented therein by the Prohibition of Horse-Races.</p>
            <p>Another time which was by them agreed upon (although they were somewhat impatient of so long stay, was at the rising of the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;) for observing that a great part of the Army was insisted upon in Parliament to be disbanded, (a thing most desired by (as of most use to) the Enemy, who concluded, That if the Army was down, nothing else could stand in their way:) And that We were not likely in reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereto, in respect of the knowledge We had of their whole Design, severall Persons being then apprehended, as guilty of that Contrivance, and divers Arms seized on in the hands of their Factors, they did hope by improving that and severall other opportunities of discontent, which might fall out during that time, that the Parliament might rise with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction, by the means whereof, their Design would be much advanced, and therefore got all things in readinesse against such a juncture of Affairs. But it having pleased God to make some further notable discovery to Us of this Conspiracy, and of the particular Persons engaged therein; the seizing of some of them both here, and in the severall Countreys, together with the bringing over Three thousand Foot, and Six hundred Horse out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did prevent them at that time, and in a great measure disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Party, to see many of them secured, who were relied upon for the Management of this Affair.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> having, according to his promise, removed himself from <hi>Cullen</hi> into <hi>Zealand,</hi> on purpose to attend this Rising, and to come hither in Person, so soon as he should understand that it took effect accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his desires; and the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> Major General <hi>Wagstaff, O-Neal,</hi> and severall others of that Party, being come actually over hither to Conduct and Lead the Design, and appointed to their severall Posts in the Nation, they agreed to make their Attempt upon the twelfth of <hi>March</hi> 1654. which they did accordingly.</p>
            <p>And observing that the Body of the Army, especially the Foot, lay about <hi>London,</hi> they designed to rise first in the West, <hi>Wales,</hi> the North, and other Remote parts of the Nation, hoping thereby to draw the Army, or a great part of it, from hence; whereupon, <hi>Kent, Surrey,</hi> and their Party in <hi>London</hi> were to rise, and so make themselves, not only Masters of the City, but form them into considerable Bodies. By the persons they had engaged,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44841:9"/> they reckoned upon Eight thousand in the North, and not fewer out of the West; and the number which should rise in these parts when the Army should have left it, to exceed both. The Garrisons and strong places they intended first to surprize and seize upon, were <hi>Portsmouth, Plymouth, York, Hull, Newcastle, Tinmouth, Chester, Shrewsbury, Yarmouth, Lyn,</hi> and <hi>Boston;</hi> as also to possesse themselves of the Isle of <hi>Ely;</hi> The Forces in the West were to have been Commanded by the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> those in the North by the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> whom they call the Earl of <hi>Rochester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What issue it pleased the Lord to bring this great and generall Design to, no man is ignorant of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Insurrection in the West was bold and dangerous in it self, and had in all likelihood increased to great Numbers of Horse and Foot by the conjunction of others of their own Party, besides such Forreign Forces, as in case of their successe, and seizing upon some place of Strength, were to have landed in those parts, had they not been prevented by the motion of some Troops, and diligence of the Officers in apprehending divers of that Party a few dayes before, and also been closely pursued by some of Our Forces, and in the conclusion supprest by a handfull of men, through the great goodnesse of God.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> which the Enemy most relied upon, fell far short of their expectation, in respect that Our Forces by their marching up and down in the Countrey, and some of them providentially, at that time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving their Quarters near to the place of Rendezvouz, gave them no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to assemble; and therefore those of them which came to the Rendezvouz at <hi>Hessam-moor,</hi> under the Conduct of the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> with an intention to surprize <hi>York,</hi> and so formed themselves into an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, separated and run away in great Confusion and Disorder, as did also those who were rendezvouzed near <hi>Morpeth</hi> to surprize <hi>Newcastle,</hi> being by the same Providence disappointed, by the coming of Three hundred Foot from <hi>Berwick,</hi> ordered thither for the security of that place.</p>
            <p>Those in <hi>North-Wales</hi> and <hi>Shropshire,</hi> part of which were designed to surprize and possesse <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Town and Castle; some of the Chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons being discovered and apprehended, the rest fled.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rufford Abey</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamshire</hi> was another place appointed for a Rendezvouz, where about Five hundred Horse met, and had with them in the Field a Cart-load of Horse-Arms, to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>m such as should come to them; but upon a sudden, a great Fear fell upon them, insomuch that they left their Arms in the open Field, and every man shifted for himself. There
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44841:9"/> were other smaller parties, as in the Town of <hi>Chester,</hi> who designed the surprize of the Castle there, and also in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> with divers other places in the Nation; but they failing in their expectations, were discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged for that time.</p>
            <p>And thus, by the goodness of God, first discovering and bringing to light these hidden Works of Darknesse, and afterwards in putting Fear into the Hearts of these men, (that their Hands could not execute what they had contrived) the greatest and most dangerous Design, not only for the invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Us in Blood and Confusion here at Home, but exposing of Us unto the Will of Forreigners, hath been defeated and brought to nothing; and this cruel and bloody Enemy, put under as great and signal Disappointments, as any Age can produce an example of; it being a thing they had set their hearts upon, and was the Work of almost Four years contrivement.</p>
            <p>And now all men would have expected, that either through the sense of Gods hand anew lifted up against them, or the other Discouragements they have met with in this their grand Undertaking; they would have been weary of any further Attempts of this kind, and have forsaken that Cause and Interest, which hath brought so many of them to ruine: But so little hath these things wrought upon them, that some of them, when they ran away from their Rendezvouz, did it with a resolution to take a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, when the Government, in confidence of the present Successe, should be secure and lesse aware of them; and they are at this very day at work upon other Designs, both here and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and are endeavouring to procure Supplies of Men and Money from Forreign States, to begin new Troubles and Rebellions amongst Us; some Agents being sent from hence for that purpose this last Summer.</p>
            <p>We shall not need to make any Application of what hath been said, it is plain to every one that is not blinded with prejudice, That these men are restlesse in their Designs, and are the causes of all our Trouble and Unsettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will leave no stone unturned, to render vain and fruitlesse, all that Blood which hath been spilt to restore Our Liberties; and the hopes We have conceived of seeing this poor Nation setled and reformed, from that Spirit of Prophaneness which these men do keep up and countenance in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all Law and Authority; And therefore We thus argued, That unlesse We would give up the Cause so long contended for, and the Lives, Liberties and Comforts of all the Well-affected of these three Nations into their hands, or leave them exposed to their continuall Attempts, the Peace and common Concernments of this Commonwealth, must be otherwise se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and provided for, then at present they were; That this was not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44841:10"/> to be done without raising Additionall Forces; That the Charge of those Forces ought not to be put upon the good People, who have born the heat and burthen of the day, but upon those who have been, and are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all Our danger.</p>
            <p>Upon these Grounds, We have been necessitated to erect a new and standing <hi>Militia</hi> of Horse in all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> under such Pay as might be without burthen to the peaceable and Well-affected, and be a fitting Encouragement to the Officers and Soldiers, that they might not go to War at their own charge; And therefore We have thought fit to lay the burthen of Maintaining of these Forces, and some other Publique Charges which are occasioned by them, upon those who have been engaged in the late Wars against the State, having respect notwithstanding therein to such of them, as are not able to undergo that Charge.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be esteemed great severity, to Tax the whole Party, when there hath been, in respect of the general number, but few convicted by Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or detected by Testimonies to have been in those Designs.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Proofs and Testimonies do not extend to charge every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall man, which will fall under this burthen, with any explicite acting, contriving, or designing for the disturbance of the Peace; if that had been the Case, their whole Estates, by the ordinary Proceedings of the Law, had been confiscate: But We do appeal to all indifferent men, who will weigh and consider the preceding Narrative, and the Contexture, Frame, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this Design. Whether the Party were not generally invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Businesse, and in reason to be charged with it.</p>
            <p>It is certain, here was the Cause and Quarrel of the pretended King, once more brought upon the stage by his Followers, who for that purpose was come into the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> ready to embarque for <hi>England,</hi> upon the first notice of Success, which no man will believe he would have put himself upon in the Eye and Face of the World, if those who shewed themselves in Arms, were to have no other Seconds then what appeared; nor will it be imagined, that those of his Party, who came over hither upon that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, as the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> and <hi>Wagstaff,</hi> and others, would have run so great hazard upon so weak Grounds: Or, that those Gentlemen who did actually rise, could suppose that the Army then in being, would be so easily over-run, with much more considerable Forces then were visible; Neither can it be presumed, that the persons chiefly relyed upon for the Conduct and Management of this Affair, and who doubtless want no credit with that Party, would have entred into this Engagement alone.</p>
            <p>Great Sums of Money are collected, and sent over to the pretended King,
<pb facs="tcp:44841:10"/> and furnisht also for this Design, which We cannot think came out of a few hands.</p>
            <p>At this time this Party were observed to be together, to keep their Meetings apart from others, to withdraw themselves in their ordinary conversation, and to carry it with more then a usuall confidence against the Well-affected of the Nation, as men under great hopes of a sudden Change, which many of them did not forbear to make their boasts of.</p>
            <p>The time when this Attempt was made, is likewise observable, It was when nothing but a well-formed Power could hope to put Us into disorder; <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> being perfectly reduced, Differences with most Neighbor Nations composed, our Forces both by Sea and Land in order and consistency; The first budding of these Imbroilments seasonably detected, and many of the engaged persons apprehended, notice given of the ensuing Danger to the whole Nation, Forces then drawn from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the disanimation of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances; and yet after all this, the wakefull Eye of an Army, of whose virtue there had been some proof in times past, could by no means discourage them from proceeding in this Attempt, nor frustrate this Rising in several parts of the Nation at one and the same time: These things alone are enough to satisfie, that these Troubles were the fruit of great deliberation and consent, and that they fel not out by chance or as the rash Undertakings of some few inconsiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; But we need not spend time upon this subject, believing that every one doth readily concur with Us, That this Design was general, and levelled against al<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> those who had upon any account whatsoever adhered to, and owned this Cause.</p>
            <p>This being then the Case, We have in our own Judgement such clear and convincing Grounds, to justifie Our Proceedings with those men which co<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld scarcely be expected in cases of secret Treasons and Conspiracies; a bare cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency wherein, hath been alwayes accounted Capital: And if t<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magistrate were in these Cases tyed up to the ordinary Rules, <gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd had not a Liberty to proceed, upon Illustrations of Reason, against those who are continually suspected, there would be wanting, in such a State, th<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> means of common Safety; Conspiracies could never be prevented nor w<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitations of Our Enemies from one mischievous Desig<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to another, ever hurt them.</p>
            <p>Besides, admit that some of that Party were as innocent, as they would now have it believed they were, enough hath been done by their Fellows in a common Cause (which hardly any of them know how to disown, which they love, and of which they glory) to draw the whole Party under a just Suspition, and the consequences thereof: All that are peaceably minded in the Nation are ready to say, These are the men of whom we go in danger, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is both just and necessary, that all those of whom the People have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be afraid (not only as their profest Enemies, but also numerous) should pay for securing the State against that Danger which they are the Authors of.</p>
            <p>And former times have held this way of Proceeding just and reasonable, of which We could give many pregnant Instances, as wel in this as in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, some of which were done in the memory of severall persons now living: And the reason why States may proceed in this manner, is, because that which
<pb facs="tcp:44841:11"/> is intended to be Exemplary, for the terrifying men from such Attempts for the future, will not otherwise be proportionable to the danger of the past Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and so the Publique Power can never be secure, whose Safety is the Peoples, but will be alwayes exposed to the same mischief and hazards.</p>
            <p>It is a trouble to Us to be still rubbing upon the old Sore, disobliging those whom we hoped time and patience might make friends; but we can with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort appeal to God, and dare also to their own Consciences, whether this way of proceeding with them hath been the matter of Our Choice, or that which We have sought an occasion for; or whether, contrary to Our own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the constant course of Our Carriage towards them (which hath been to oblige them by kindnesse to forsake their former Principles, which God hath so often, and so eminently born witnesse against) We have not been constrained and necessitated hereunto, and without the doing whereof, We should have been wanting to our Duty to God and these Nations.</p>
            <p>That Character of Difference between them and the rest of the People, which is now put upon them, is occasioned by themselves, not by Us; There is nothing they have more industriously laboured in then this, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves separated, and distinguisht from the Well-affected of this Nation: To which end they have kept their conversation apart, as if they would avoid the very beginnings of Union, have bred and educated their Children by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred and ejected Clergy, and very much confined their Marriages and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances within their own Party, as if they meant to entail their Quarrel and prevent the means to reconcile Posterity; which with the great pains they take <gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pon all occasions to lessons and suppress the Esteem and Honor of the English Nation, in all their Actions and Undertakings abroad, striving withal to make oth<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> have separated themselves from the Body of the Nation; and therefore we leave to all mankinde to judge, whether we ought not to be timely jealous of that Se<gap reason="illegible: page creased" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time, We do assure our selves, that the good and wel-affected of the Land, for whose sake We have chiefly published these things, that they may know the Grounds on which We do proceed towards their Preservation, will receive Encouragement hereby, and enjoy with love and Unity amongst themselves, the Fruits and Effects of that common Interest which they have long pursued, and not suffer themselves to be divided by any artifices whatsoever, into Parties and Factions one against the other, whereof the Enemy hath made great advantages, to keep us from that Settlement and Reformation, which every good man longs for, and the want whereof doth greatly provoke the Lord against us.</p>
